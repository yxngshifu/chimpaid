    <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
    <p1>
    These terms will automatically apply to you if you download or use the Chimpaid website, so you should be sure to read them thoroughly before using the site. You are not permitted to copy or modify the site, any component of the site, or our trademarks in any way. It is not permitted to try to extract the site's source code, translate it into different languages, or create derivative versions. The site itself, along with its associated trade names, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights, remain the property of Chimpaid.

Keeping the site as practical and effective as feasible is a priority for Chimpaid. We hereby reserve the right to alter the site or impose fees for its services at any moment and for any cause. Without making it very obvious to you exactly what you're paying for, we will never charge you for the site or its services.

In order to deliver our Service, we keep and process the personal data that you have supplied to us through the Chimpaid site. You are in charge of maintaining the security of both the website and your phone. Because of this, we advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing official software constraints. 
Chimpaid won't be held accountable for some things, so you should be aware of it. The site will need to have a working internet connection in order to perform some features. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network carrier, but Chimpaid cannot be held liable if the site doesn't function properly if you don't have access to Wi-Fi or if you've used all of your data allotment and have no more to use.

Remember that the terms of your contract with your mobile network carrier will still be in effect if you use the site outside of a Wi-Fi hotspot. As a result, you can be assessed fees by your mobile service provider for the price of data for the duration of other third party fees, or the connection while using the site. You agree to pay all fees associated with using the site, including roaming data fees if you use it outside of your home area (i.e., region or nation) without turning off data roaming. We assume that you have permission from the bill payer to use the site if you are not the one paying the bill for the device on which you are using it. If this is not the case, kindly be aware.

In a similar vein, Chimpaid cannot always be held accountable for your usage of the site, including but not limited to: In order to use the Service, you must keep your device charged; Chimpaid cannot be held responsible if it runs out of battery and you are unable to switch it on.
Regarding Chimpaidâ€™s liability for your use of the site, it's critical to remember that, despite our efforts to keep it current and accurate at all times, we do depend on outside parties to supply information to us so that we can make it available to you. No damages, whether direct or indirect, will be covered by Chimpaid
